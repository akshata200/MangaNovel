            <p>When I opened my eyes, I was inside a novel.</p>
            <p>[The Birth of a Hero].</p>
            <p>[The Birth of a Hero] was a novel focused on the adventures of the main character, Choi Han, a high
                school boy who was transported to a different dimension from Earth, along with the birth of the
                numerous heroes of the continent.</p>
            <p>I became a part of that novel as the Trash Count, the family that oversaw the territory where the
                first village that Choi Han visits is located.</p>
            <p>The problem is that Choi Han becomes twisted after that village, and everyone in it, are destroyed by
                assassins.</p>
            <p>The bigger problem is the fact that this stupid trash who I’ve become doesn’t know about what
                happened in the village and messes with Choi Han, only to get beaten to a pulp.</p>
            <p>“...This is going to be a problem.”</p>
            <p>I feel like something serious has happened to me. </p>
            <p>But it was worth trying to make this my new life.</p>
